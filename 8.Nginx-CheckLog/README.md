# Task 8 - NGINX Check logs

### **Description**
Write a script that gets the access log file for a site (Nginx) and return the number of the visits that match a given date (input date, example: > visitors “2017-20-10”)

### **Approach**

**Sintaxis:** `visitors.sh year-day-mont`

### **Technologies**
- NGINX
- Bash
